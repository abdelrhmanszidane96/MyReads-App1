# MyReads Project
 This project can be used to search for book titles and store them on different shelves depending on what you are currently reading, what you have read and what you would like to read.
 
 In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves", each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
(Currently Reading - Want to Read - Read)
